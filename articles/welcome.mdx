# Welcome!
## Intro
In the past I have been working on various dev blogs, mostly about video game programming.
I could also use them as a relatively up-to-date portfolio to share with folks who wanted
to know what I was working on.

This time is bit different, this blog will be a mixture of different things that I like:
video games, computer science, music making, art experiments, travelling and style. Whew!
An ambitious list of subjects to cover... plenty of fun to have, please enjoy your journey
here!

## Tech behind this blog
Nowadays, there is an incredible amount of blogging platforms: Wordpress, Medium,
Tumblr. They are all valid and fool-proof options to create a blog in a short amount of time.

To experiment with new frameworks, I decided to go from almost zero and reinvent the wheel,
when necessary. This blog is powered by [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/),
a popular framework I am familiar with. The sources are all available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/morukutsu/new_dev_blog) and are hosted on [Now](https://zeit.co/now)
for minimal maintenance work.
